# How we used Python

Here are some [best-practices] for python.

## Constructs we use

### \_\_init\_\_

Is the constructor for a class.

### \_\_main\_\_ â€” Top-level code environment

`__main__` is the name of the environment where top-level code is run. It's the first Python module which starts running.
It's the `entry point` of the application.

See [source] for more information.

### Property Decorator

For creating properties, we used the [Property Decorator].

## Modules

A module can be a collection of classes.

## Classes

Rover is a class (can be more than one)
map is also a class
window is also a class (need inheritance from tk)

### Inheritance in Python

See [Inheritance] for more information.

To call the parent method use the `super()` keyword.

To call the current method of the class, use the `self` keyword.

## Naming styles

[Real Pyhton naming styles]

[Private variables] doesn't exists in python, you just give them a different name.

### Single and double underscore

Single Trailing Underscore( var_ ): Used by convention to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords. Double Leading Underscore( __var ): Triggers name mangling when used in a class context. Enforced by the Python interpreter.

# Space Rover Documentation

This is the technical documentation for our space rover game we programmed as a project at our education we're currently on at the [TEKO Schweizerische Fachschule].
We are very grateful that we have te opportunity to do this education and we can get a lot of practical knowledge.
A big thank you to our teacher Bruno Hammer who accompanied us through this work and saved us a lot of unnecessary work.

In this documentation we only describe the technical rules and architecture, everything that is code related is described here.
We also created a projectmanagement documentation in which is the process described about everything project related. We deliberately made a cut so that we have a clear separation between code and project.

This codebase is not intendet to get updated soon. But feel free to send us your improvements if you want to. We are open for new ideas.

## About

The game space rover is just in the beginning to grow. The idea is to create a game, where a rover can drive through a map and doesn't hit the obstacles. It has a start- and endpoint. If the rover hits the endpoint, the level is finished.

In fututre releases, we want to implement some enemies the rover has to shoot down.
There should also be a ranking at the end of the game, to compare the time with other players.
Adding some soundeffects is also something we're tinking of implementing.

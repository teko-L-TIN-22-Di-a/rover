# How to contribute

You have a cool idea or you found a bug in our code? Please feel free to create a [fork] of our repository and create a [Pull Request].  
If you're new to pyhton, here's a guide how to contribute to our repository and get a part of our space rover game.

## Step by step guide to contribute

### 1. Create a Fork

We use the [Gitflow Workflow]. The first thing you need to do is create a [fork] of our repository.

### 2. Clone repository

Next step, you need to [clone] your forked repository to your local machine.

``` ps
git clone <repositoryUrl>
```

### 3. Setup your environment

We recommend working with Visual Studio Code. Have a look into the [vs code installation guide] and follow the steps.

### 4. Install dependencies

Download latest [pyhton] version and click through installation. Maybe you have to restart your machine after this step.

Run the following commands to install the dependencies we used.

#### PyGame

``` ps
pip install pygame
```

#### MkDocs

``` ps
pip install mkdocs
```

For more information how to run mkdocs and how we used it, have a look at [mkdocs.md]
